This is a bestiary for Dungeons and Dragons!

It includes some hard coded back end data without a Ruby back end at the moment. The data is held in a local JSON file and therefore can be manipulated from this repo alone.

Therefore to start open up a second terminal and watch the monsters.json file to use the local back end.

This app lets one add and favorite monsters in DnD, show the amount of them in battle or defeated, search for monsters, as well as add your own with image.

Built with React, JavaScript, JSX, HTML, and CSS for styling.
